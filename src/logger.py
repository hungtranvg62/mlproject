logger.py

This module is responsible for setting up logging for the project.

Logging is the practice of recording events, messages, and errors that occur
while a program is running. It is an essential tool for understanding the flow
of execution, diagnosing issues, and keeping track of what the code is doing
at different stages.

In a machine learning project, logging is especially useful because it helps:
- Monitor the progress of data processing and model training.
- Capture errors and exceptions for easier debugging.
- Keep a record of experiments and results for reproducibility.
